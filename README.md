## Data Science for Everyone: Course Activities

### Introduction
Welcome to the "Data Science for Everyone" course! This repository contains the activities and projects completed during the course, focusing on fundamental concepts and practical applications in the field of data science. Throughout the course, we explore various topics including **pandas**, **Python programming**, **data visualization**, and **data prediction**.

### Objectives
The primary objectives of the course activities are to:

- Develop proficiency in using **pandas** for data manipulation and analysis.
- Strengthen **Python programming** skills for data science applications.
- Gain expertise in creating informative visualizations to communicate insights effectively.
- Understand the principles and techniques of **data prediction** and modeling.

### Repository Contents
1. **Notebooks/**: Folder containing Jupyter notebooks for each activity and project.
2. **Data/**: Directory storing datasets used in the activities and projects.
3. **Scripts/**: Folder containing Python scripts and modules developed during the course.
4. **Visualizations/**: Directory containing visualizations generated during data analysis.
5. **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the course activities and repository contents.

### Activities Overview
1. **Pandas Basics**: Introduction to **pandas** library for data manipulation and analysis.
2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Techniques for cleaning and preprocessing raw data.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducting EDA to gain insights into the dataset.
4. **Data Visualization**: Creating visualizations using **matplotlib**, **seaborn**, and **Plotly**.
5. **Introduction to Machine Learning**: Basic concepts of machine learning and data prediction.
6. **Model Building and Evaluation**: Building predictive models and evaluating their performance.
